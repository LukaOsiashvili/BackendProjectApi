This is a little breakdown of project.

Project is made in mind that every module and route should be used for frontend dashboard application.
Address, Branches and Cities collections and routes are auxiliary data, used for easily submitting Orders in database.
They can be used to fetch data to be put in <select> claws for example, or something like that, so UX will be easier.

Main Components are Orders, Workers and more or less Products collections and routes. In it will be embedded auxiliary data.
Lastly Permissions collection is used for system, during registration it might be used or during updating Worker data from
admin panel in dashboard. It's working principle is that if during registration permissions field is missing, but role will
be for sure entered, it will fetch data from permissions collection which designed as array of names of permission and
for role it is for.


Every route needs permission to be fetched, except /worker/registration, /worker/login, /products/all (permission names are
available in corresponding routes file).

Please, any feedback regarding the project will be appreciated.
